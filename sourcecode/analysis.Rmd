Here the result of the Multiple (Linear) Regression :

```{r, echo=FALSE}
dataset <- read.csv("../data//dataset.csv")
fit <- lm(importValue ~ politicalStability + governmentEffectiveness + ruleOfLaw, data=dataset)
summary(fit) # show results
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(fit) # plot results
```

Note: That Result is preliminary and need to be validate.
